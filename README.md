# CodeQualityChecker

Use this code to check the quality standard of your code.
Make configurations in the configuration.py file.

Features:

1. Variable Name Length Checker:

  Configure what the minimum length of a variable namne should be and check for it.
  Currently works for JS, Java, C, Python. 
  
  Known Issues:
  1. have to include addtional logic for conditional statements. (eg: if(x == y))
  
2. Function Name Length Checker:

Configure a mininmum length you want your function name to be and check for it.
Currently works for only Python.


Right now the only check is whether variable lengths in your code is less than 4 :P

Adding more functionality later:
  1. function name length for JS, Java, C, C++
  2. length of a function
